**Predicting the likelihood of a client repaying the loan.**
In this case, I have used a Decision Tree classifier with **entropy** as the criterion. 
The Decision Tree classifier algorithm uses a tree structure to make predictions, and one can choose **entropy** or the **Gini Index** as the criterion
to measure the purity of the dataset. The goal is to find the split that results in the highest information gain, 
thereby improving the model's ability to classify the data correctly.
